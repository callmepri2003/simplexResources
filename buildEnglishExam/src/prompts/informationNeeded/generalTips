- Focus on NSW English K-10 Syllabus (2022) outcomes for reading, writing, and language conventions
- Questions should be appropriately challenging for students - not too easy, but achievable with effort
- Use Australian spellings throughout (e.g., 'colour', 'favourite', 'organise')
- Reading passages should be age-appropriate, engaging, and around 200-400 words
- Include a mix of literal and inferential comprehension questions
- Grammar and vocabulary questions should be based on the student's year expectations (adjectives, verbs, nouns, sentence types, punctuation)
- Writing prompts should allow for creativity while providing clear structure and requirements
- Always include mark allocations for questions to help students understand weighting
- Provide adequate writing space (WritingLines) based on expected answer length
- Use ImagePlaceholder components with descriptive text when images would enhance questions - DO NOT include imageUrl values, leave them empty for manual insertion later
- Keep headings succinct as they render large
- Don't place two headings directly next to each other without content between them
- Ensure sufficient volume - parents value comprehensive assessments
- Question numbers should be sequential and clear (1, 2, 3... or 1a, 1b, 1c for sub-questions)
- Include variety in question types: comprehension, multiple choice, vocabulary, grammar, and writing tasks
- Writing tasks should specify word count expectations appropriate for students (typically 100-200 words)
- Use ExamSection components to clearly delineate different parts of the assessment (Reading, Language Conventions, Writing)
