# CORE PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES

## Understanding Your Students (Years 3-12)

### Age-Appropriate Communication
**CRITICAL: Match language complexity to year level**

**Years 3-4 (Ages 8-9):**
- Use simple, everyday words. Avoid: "determine", "evaluate", "analyze"
- Use: "find", "work out", "figure out", "solve"
- Short sentences (10-15 words max)
- Concrete examples from their daily life (toys, playground, lunchbox)
- Questions like: "If you have 3 groups of 4 apples, how many apples do you have?"

**Years 5-6 (Ages 10-11):**
- Introduce basic mathematical terms gradually
- Use: "calculate", "explain", "compare" but define them first
- Mix concrete and slightly abstract examples
- Questions involving money, sports scores, simple recipes

**Years 7-8 (Ages 12-13):**
- Standard mathematical vocabulary acceptable
- Can use terms like "coefficient", "variable", "integer" with brief explanations
- Real-world contexts: shopping discounts, phone plans, sports statistics
- Multi-step problems are appropriate

**Years 9-10 (Ages 14-15):**
- Full mathematical terminology
- Abstract reasoning expected
- Complex real-world applications
- Can use terms without definition if previously taught

**Years 11-12 (Ages 16-18):**
- Advanced mathematical language
- Formal mathematical reasoning
- Complex abstract problems
- University-preparation level contexts

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Primary (Years 3-6):** One new concept per lesson maximum
- **Junior Secondary (Years 7-8):** 1-2 related concepts per lesson
- **Senior Secondary (Years 9-12):** 2-3 related concepts, building on each other

## Lesson Structure (2 Hour Format)

### Time Allocation for In-Class Resources
Your in-class resource should support this structure:

**First Hour (60 min):**
- 0-5 min: RetrievalPractice (warm-up, prior knowledge)
- 5-25 min: New concept introduction (Text, ExplanationBox, FormulaCard)
- 25-40 min: Worked examples (StepByStepSolution - 2-3 examples)
- 40-60 min: Guided practice (PractiseQuestions - 6-8 questions)

**Second Hour (60 min):**
- 0-5 min: Common misconceptions (CommonMisconception, WorkedErrorExample)
- 5-30 min: Independent practice (PractiseQuestions - 8-12 questions)
- 30-50 min: Challenge/extension work (harder PractiseQuestions)
- 50-60 min: Review and preview (KeyTakeaway, MetacognitivePrompt)

### Content Volume Guidelines

**IN-CLASS RESOURCES (should fill 2 hours with tutor guidance):**
- 1-2 RetrievalPractice questions
- 1000-1500 words explanatory content (broken into digestible chunks)
- 2-4 worked examples (StepByStepSolution)
- 1-2 CommonMisconception or WorkedErrorExample
- 15-20 practice questions total (mix of difficulty)
  * 5-7 basic (direct application)
  * 6-8 medium (require thinking)
  * 3-5 challenging (extension)
- 2-3 MetacognitivePrompt throughout
- 1 KeyTakeaway at end

**HOMEWORK RESOURCES (should take 45-60 min independently):**
- 1 RetrievalPractice (2-3 questions from previous weeks)
- 500-800 words of review/reinforcement content
- 1-2 worked example reminders
- 20-25 practice questions
  * 8-10 fluency builders (similar to class work)
  * 8-10 standard difficulty
  * 4-5 challenging/extension
- 1-2 reflection questions (require written explanation)
- 1 KeyTakeaway
- 1 HomeworkComment component at the very end

## Question Design Principles

### Question Vocabulary Guidelines

**AVOID these words for younger students:**
- Years 3-6: "determine", "deduce", "hence", "thus", "subsequently"
- Years 3-8: "arbitrary", "trivial", "optimization", "asymptotic"

**USE age-appropriate alternatives:**
- Instead of "determine" → "find" or "work out"
- Instead of "evaluate" (Years 3-6) → "calculate" or "work out the answer"
- Instead of "hence" → "so" or "therefore"
- Instead of "subsequently" → "then" or "next"

### Context Appropriateness

**Years 3-4:** Toys, animals, playground, family, lunch, simple games
**Years 5-6:** Sports teams, pocket money, basic recipes, simple measurements
**Years 7-8:** Shopping, phone plans, sports statistics, travel, movies
**Years 9-10:** Business, investments, technology, complex sports analytics
**Years 11-12:** Economics, engineering, sciences, advanced applications

## Component Usage Strategy

## Technical Requirements

### LaTeX Formatting (CRITICAL)
**ONLY acceptable format:**
```
"\\begin{align*} x^2 + 2x + 1 \\end{align*}"
```

**Common LaTeX patterns:**
- Fractions: `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}`
- Powers: `x^{2}`, `a^{n}`
- Roots: `\\sqrt{x}`, `\\sqrt[3]{x}`
- Subscripts: `x_{1}`, `a_{n}`
- Multi-line (use \\\\ between lines): `"\\begin{align*} x + 2 = 5 \\\\ x = 3 \\end{align*}"`

**NEVER use:** `$$`, `\(`, `\)`, or markdown code blocks for math

### Australian Standards
- Spelling: colour, analyse, centre, metre, aluminium, organisation
- Currency: $ for dollars, c for cents (e.g., $4.50, 75c)
- Measurements: Metric only (km, m, cm, mm, kg, g, L, mL)
- Date format: DD/MM/YYYY
- Decimal: 3.5 (not 3,5)

### ID Generation
- Format: `"{componentType}-{topic-slug}-{sequence}"`
- Example: `"explanation-pythagoras-theorem-1"`, `"question-linear-equations-7"`
- Be consistent within each document
- Keep IDs lowercase with hyphens

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pedagogical Errors
✗ Using vocabulary above year level (MOST COMMON ERROR)
✗ Questions too complex for the age group
✗ Skipping steps in worked examples
✗ No connection to prior knowledge
✗ Explaining procedures without conceptual reasoning
✗ All easy questions then sudden jump to hard
✗ Abstract examples without concrete foundation (especially Years 3-8)

### Technical Errors
✗ Wrong LaTeX format (use \\begin{align*} only)
✗ Consecutive headings without content between
✗ Using GeneralPurpose when specific components exist
✗ American spellings
✗ Missing HomeworkComment on homework
✗ Missing WeeklyTitle on in-class resources

### Structural Errors
✗ Too little volume (parents expect substantial resources)
✗ Questions not scaffolded by difficulty
✗ No retrieval practice from previous weeks
✗ Missing metacognitive prompts for older students
✗ No error analysis or misconception addressing

## Year-Level Specific Guidelines

### Primary (Years 3-6)
- Concrete before abstract ALWAYS
- Visual representations crucial (use ContentPlaceholder for diagrams)
- Short explanations (2-3 sentences per concept)
- Familiar, everyday contexts only
- Avoid: algebraic notation (Years 3-4), complex word problems
- Simple, direct language
- Lots of practice questions (volume matters)

### Junior Secondary (Years 7-8)
- Transition to abstract thinking
- Introduce formal mathematical language gradually
- Real-world contexts they understand
- Mix concrete and abstract examples
- Can handle multi-step problems
- Encourage multiple solution methods

### Senior Secondary (Years 9-12)
- Abstract reasoning expected
- Formal mathematical communication
- Complex real-world applications
- Proof and reasoning questions appropriate
- University preparation level (Years 11-12)
- Advanced problem-solving strategies

## Resource Type Specific Tips

### In-Class Resources
- More explanation, less independent work
- Include discussion prompts
- Space for tutor to elaborate
- Worked examples should be detailed
- Questions designed for guided practice
- Include MetacognitivePrompt before complex problems

### Homework Resources  
- Brief review/reminder of concepts
- More independent practice volume
- Clear, self-explanatory questions
- Mix of routine and challenging problems
- Interleave previous topics (spaced repetition)
- MUST end with HomeworkComment component

## General Technical Notes

- Don't rely on GeneralPurpose component (error-prone); use specific components
- Keep headings succinct (they render large)
- First heading should be week number (e.g., "Week 1", "Week 2")
- Never have 2 headings consecutively without content between
- Abstract backend terms ('workshop', 'in-class', '2 hours') from the actual content

## Final Quality Check

Before generating, ask yourself:
1. Would a student at this year level understand every word?
2. Are the contexts familiar and age-appropriate?
3. Is there enough volume for the time allocation?
4. Are misconceptions addressed proactively?
5. Is there a clear learning progression?
6. Are all technical requirements met (LaTeX, IDs, Australian spelling)?
7. Does this resource actually teach, not just test?

**Remember: The goal is measurable learning gains. Every component should serve learning.**
