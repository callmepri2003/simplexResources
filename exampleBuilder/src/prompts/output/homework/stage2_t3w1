Syllabus Topic: Year 3-4 Mathematics Term 3 Week 1 - Mental Computation Strategies Review: Consolidate and extend mental computation strategies for all four operations. Students select and apply efficient mental methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Review and practice number facts to develop fluency and automaticity. Use estimation strategies to check reasonableness of calculations. Apply mental computation in real-world problem-solving contexts. Explore patterns in number facts and use these to extend learning. Compare different mental strategies and discuss efficiency for various problem types. Use calculators appropriately to support learning and check calculations. Problem-solving involving multi-step calculations using mental strategies. Working mathematically through selecting appropriate strategies, justifying mathematical thinking, and explaining computational choices for different problem contexts.

- don't rely on GeneralPurpose component too much as it is prone to formatting errors, and if you use it just make sure its super basic so theres not much opportunity for error
- this is aimed at high achievers to all questions should be on the difficult end of the year level
- volume is a huge factor for parents, they don't like short homework/resources
- the 'workshop', 'homework', 'inclass', '2 hours' all this stuff is backend stuff and should be abstracted from the resources.
- keep the headings succint, because they're large
- Each document's first heading should be which week it is like 'week 1', 'week 2', etc
- Use Australian spellings
- 2 headings shouldn't go next to each other
- If you are generating homework as opposed to class work, make sure there's enough volume of questions, quantity matters just as much as quality
