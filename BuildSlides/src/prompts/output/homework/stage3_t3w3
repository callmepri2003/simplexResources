Syllabus Topic: Year 5-6 Mathematics Term 3 Week 3 - Percentage Concepts and Applications: Introduce percentages as parts per hundred and connect to fraction and decimal representations. Students understand percentages in practical contexts including discounts, interest, statistics and data representation. Convert between fractions, decimals and percentages for common equivalents. Use percentage concepts in financial mathematics including calculating discounts, markups and simple interest. Apply percentages to interpret data displays and statistical information. Use mental strategies and calculators for percentage calculations. Understand percentage change including increases and decreases. Problem-solving involving percentages in shopping, business, statistics and everyday contexts. Working mathematically through explaining percentage concepts, selecting appropriate calculation methods, and applying percentage reasoning to practical situations requiring percentage understanding and calculation.

Generate homework that builds independent learning skills while reinforcing classroom concepts.

- don't rely on GeneralPurpose component too much as it is prone to formatting errors, and if you use it just make sure its super basic so theres not much opportunity for error
- this is aimed at high achievers to all questions should be on the difficult end of the year level
- volume is a huge factor for parents, they don't like short homework/resources
- the 'workshop', 'homework', 'inclass', '2 hours' all this stuff is backend stuff and should be abstracted from the resources.
- keep the headings succint, because they're large
- Each document's first heading should be which week it is like 'week 1', 'week 2', etc
- Use Australian spellings
- 2 headings shouldn't go next to each other
- If you are generating homework as opposed to class work, make sure there's enough volume of questions, quantity matters just as much as quality, think about other tutoring resources.
- Always provide LaTeX as a single-line, JSON-escaped string wrapped in \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*} with all backslashes doubled (\\). Avoid using $$, \(, or multiline LaTeX, as only this format works reliably.
