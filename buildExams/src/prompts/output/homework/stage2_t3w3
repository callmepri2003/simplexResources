Syllabus Topic: Year 3-4 Mathematics Term 3 Week 3 - Fraction Operations and Mixed Numbers: Extend fraction understanding to include addition and subtraction of fractions with the same denominator. Students explore improper fractions and mixed numbers using concrete materials and visual models. Convert between improper fractions and mixed numbers. Add and subtract fractions with same denominators in practical contexts. Understand relationship between whole numbers, fractions, and mixed numbers. Use number lines to represent and operate with fractions. Solve problems involving fractions in measurement, cooking, and sharing contexts. Compare and order mixed numbers and improper fractions. Working mathematically through explaining fraction operations, justifying conversion methods, and connecting fraction concepts to real-world applications requiring fractional thinking.

- don't rely on GeneralPurpose component too much as it is prone to formatting errors, and if you use it just make sure its super basic so theres not much opportunity for error
- this is aimed at high achievers to all questions should be on the difficult end of the year level
- volume is a huge factor for parents, they don't like short homework/resources
- the 'workshop', 'homework', 'inclass', '2 hours' all this stuff is backend stuff and should be abstracted from the resources.
- keep the headings succint, because they're large
- Each document's first heading should be which week it is like 'week 1', 'week 2', etc
- Use Australian spellings
- 2 headings shouldn't go next to each other
- If you are generating homework as opposed to class work, make sure there's enough volume of questions, quantity matters just as much as quality, think about other tutoring resources.
- Always provide LaTeX as a single-line, JSON-escaped string wrapped in \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*} with all backslashes doubled (\\). Avoid using $$, \(, or multiline LaTeX, as only this format works reliably.
