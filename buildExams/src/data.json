Unlike most invertebrates, octopuses possess large, complex brains and exhibit behaviours that suggest genuine intelligence. They can navigate mazes, open jars to retrieve food, and even use tools—a trait once thought exclusive to vertebrates. Perhaps most astonishingly, octopuses in captivity have been observed escaping from their tanks, crawling across laboratory floors, and entering other tanks to hunt fish before returning to their own enclosures. This ability to plan and execute complex sequences of actions suggests a level of cognitive sophistication that continues to surprise researchers. However, octopuses are solitary creatures with short lifespans, typically living only 1-2 years. This means each octopus must learn survival skills independently, without the benefit of parental teaching or social learning from peers.</em>"
